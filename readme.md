<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<br>
My name is Bassel and I am a self-taught developer and I've writing in various languages since the 9th grade! I'm currently learning cross-platform development using React Native and Expo. Have a look through my repositories and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything that you see here.

-   ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on mobile app that includes a tuner/metronome/practice calendar for musicians called NoteBuddy.
-   ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reviewing my knowledge on competitive programming and general problem-solving.
-   âš¡ Fun fact: an avid guitar player. I really like prog and grunge!
