<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<br>
My name is Bassel and I am a self-taught developer with about 3 years of experience. I'm currently looking to make the transition from C/C++ to Flutter and WebDev. Have a look through my repositories and feel free to reach out if you want to discuss anything that you see here.

<br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of front-end web development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reviewing my knowledge on the basic WebDev stack (HTML/CSS/JS) and learning Flutter.
- âš¡ Fun fact: an avid guitar player. I really like prog and grunge!
